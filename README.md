## GraphQL server with TypeScript

**This is an example on how to create a GraphQL server with TypeScript. [Read more on my blog post](https://kostasbariotis.com/graphql-server-typescript).**

A simple GraphQL server using TypeScript, Koa and [apollo-graphql-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-koa). It also provides a basic file structure to separate the schema and the resolvers to different files.

Tests included!

### Usage

To build the server:

> `yarn build`

To start the server:

> `yarn start`

To run the tests:

> `yarn test`
